Course Companion FTE | Agent Factory Hackathon 1. Executive Summary 1.1 The Challenge Build a Course Companion FTE — a Digital Full-Time Equivalent that serves as a 24/7 educational tutor, working 168 hours per week at 85-90% cost savings compared to human tutors. 1.2 The Innovation This hackathon applies the Agent Factory Architecture to education: • General Agents (Claude Code) manufacture the Custom Agent using Spec-Driven Development • Custom Agents (Digital FTE) deliver tutoring at scale with enterprise-grade reliability • Dual Frontends - ChatGPT App (Phase 1 and 2) + Web (Phase 3) provide maximum reach • Zero-Backend-LLM Default ensures cost efficiency and scalability (Phase 1) 1.3 The Outcome A production-ready Digital FTE that can: • Tutor thousands of students simultaneously • Operate 24/7 without fatigue • Students can use the app from inside ChatGPT or a stand alone Web App • Maintain 99%+ consistency in educational delivery • Scale from 10 to 100,000 users without linear cost increase The hackathon enforces a modern AI architecture principle: start with a Zero ‑ Backend ‑ LLM architecture (see Appendix I) by default (Phase 1), and introduce Hybrid intelligence (Phase 2) only where it is demonstrably valuable, cost ‑ justified, and premium. In Phase 3 a stand alone end-to-end Web App is required to be built with full features. Panaversity Agent Factory Development | Page 2 of 24

Course Companion FTE | Agent Factory Hackathon 2. The Digital FTE Thesis "In the AI era, the most valuable educational platforms won't sell courses — they'll hire Digital Tutors that work 168 hours per week, powered by agents, specs, skills, MCP , and cloud-native technologies." 2.1 Human Tutor vs Digital FTE Comparison Feature Human Tutor Course Companion FTE Availability 40 hours/week 168 hours/week (24/7) Monthly Cost $2,000 – $5,000 $200 – $500 Students per Tutor 20-50 Unlimited (concurrent) Consistency Variable (85–95%) Predictable (99%+) Ramp-up Time Weeks of training Instant (via SKILL.md) Personalization Limited by time Infinite patience Cost per Session $25 – $100 $0.10 – $0.50 Language Support 1-3 languages 50+ languages The 'Aha!' Moment A Digital Tutor FTE can conduct 50,000+ tutoring sessions per month at approximately $0.25 per session — compared to $50+ for human tutoring. This represents a 99% cost reduction while maintaining quality through guardrails and Agent Skills. Panaversity Agent Factory Development | Page 3 of 24

Course Companion FTE | Agent Factory Hackathon 3. Project Overview 3.1 What You're Building An AI-Native Course Companion that: 1. Teaches — Delivers course content with intelligent navigation 2. Explains — Breaks down concepts at the learner's level 3. Quizzes — Tests understanding with immediate feedback 4. Tracks — Monitors progress and identifies knowledge gaps 5. Adapts — Adjusts difficulty and approach (Phase 2) 6. Web App — Provides a Comprehensive Stand Alone Web App (Phase 3) 3.2 Dual Frontend Architecture Teams must build two frontends that share backend features but separate code base: Component Technology Purpose ChatGPT App Frontend (Phase 1) OpenAI Apps SDK Conversational UI, 800M+ user reach Deterministic Backend (Phase 1) FastAPI (Python) Content APIs, Quiz APIs, Progress APIs Hybrid Backend (Phase 2) FastAPI (Python) + LLM API Calls Paid Premium Features Web Frontend (Phase 3) Next.js / React Full LMS dashboard, progress visuals, admin features Consolidated Backend (Phase 3) FastAPI (Python) + LLM API Calls All Features Content Storage (Phase 1, 2, and 3) Cloudflare R2 Course content, media assets, quiz banks 3.3 Course Content Options Teams must choose ONE course topic to build their FTE around: Option Course Topic Suggested Content A AI Agent Development Claude Agent SDK concepts, MCP, Agent Skills B Cloud-Native Python FastAPI, Containers, Kubernetes basics C Generative AI Fundamentals LLMs, Prompting, RAG, Fine-tuning D Modern Python Modern Python with Typing Panaversity Agent Factory Development | Page 4 of 24

Course Companion FTE | Agent Factory Hackathon 4. Architecture Overview 4.1 Agent Factory Context This project implements the Agent Factory Architecture where: • You (the team) write the Spec (requirements, guardrails, skills) • General Agent (Claude Code) manufactures the Custom Agent code • Custom Agent (Course Companion FTE) runs in production serving students 4.2 Technical Stack Layers Following the Agent Factory 8-layer architecture: Layer Technology Purpose Phase L0 Agent Sandbox (gVisor) Secure execution Phase 2 and 3 L1 Apache Kafka Event backbone Phase 2 and 3 L2 Dapr + Workflows Infrastructure + Durability Phase 2 and 3 L3 FastAPI HTTP interface + A2A Phase 1, 2, and 3 L4 OpenAI Agents SDK High-level orchestration Phase 2 and 3 L5 Claude Agent SDK Agentic execution Phase 2 and 3 L6 Runtime Skills + MCP Domain knowledge + Tools Phase 1, 2, and 3 L7 A2A Protocol Multi-FTE collaboration Phase 2 and 3 Phase 1 Focus: L3 (FastAPI) + L6 (Skills + MCP) — Deterministic backend Phase 2 Addition: L4 + L5 (Hybrid SDK) for premium features 4.3 Zero-Backend-LLM Architecture Principle Key Insight: In Phase 1, ChatGPT does ALL the intelligent work. Your backend is purely deterministic — serving content, tracking progress, and enforcing rules. This means near-zero marginal cost per user. Backend Responsibilities ChatGPT Responsibilities • Serve content verbatim from R2 • Track progress and streaks • Grade quizzes (rule-based) • Enforce access control • Search content (keyword/embedding) • Explain concepts at learner's level • Provide analogies and examples • Answer questions from content • Encourage and motivate • Adapt tone to student Panaversity Agent Factory Development | Page 5 of 24

Course Companion FTE | Agent Factory Hackathon 5. Phase 1 ChatGPT App: Zero-Backend-LLM 5.1 Phase 1 Goal Build a fully functional Course Companion where: • Backend performs ZERO LLM inference • ChatGPT handles ALL explanation, tutoring, and adaptation • System is production-viable and can scale to 100k+ users cheaply 5.2 Architecture Rules (STRICT) Zero ‑ Backend ‑ LLM: User → ChatGPT App → Deterministic Backend ✅ ALLOWED in Backend Component Purpose Example Content APIs Serve course material GET /chapters/{id} Navigation APIs Chapter sequencing GET /chapters/{id}/next Quiz APIs Rule-based grading POST /quizzes/{id}/submit Progress APIs Track completion PUT /progress/{user_id} Search APIs Keyword/semantic search GET /search?q=neural+networks Access Control Freemium gating GET /access/check ❌ NOT ALLOWED in Backend Forbidden Why LLM API calls Violates Zero-Backend-LLM RAG summarization LLM inference Prompt orchestration LLM inference Agent loops Must be in ChatGPT Content generation Pre-generate only 5.3 Required Features (Phase 1) All teams must implement these 6 features in Phase 1: # Feature Backend Does ChatGPT Does 1 Content Delivery Serve content verbatim Explain at learner's level 2 Navigation Return next/previous chapters Suggest optimal path 3 Grounded Q&A Return relevant sections Answer using content only 4 Rule-Based Quizzes Grade with answer key Present, encourage, explain 5 Progress Tracking Store completion, streaks Celebrate, motivate 6 Freemium Gate Check access rights Explain premium gracefully Panaversity Agent Factory Development | Page 6 of 24

Course Companion FTE | Agent Factory Hackathon 5.4 Disqualification Criteria Teams are IMMEDIATELY DISQUALIFIED from Phase 1 if the backend contains ANY LLM API calls, summarization logic, or agent loops. Detection method: Code review + API audit. Panaversity Agent Factory Development | Page 7 of 24

Course Companion FTE | Agent Factory Hackathon 6. Phase 2 ChatGPT App: Hybrid Intelligence (Paid Premium) 6.1 Phase 2 Goal Add selective backend intelligence that: • Delivers clear additional educational value • Is cost-justified as a premium feature • Is cleanly isolated from Phase 1 logic Teams must explain why each hybrid feature cannot be implemented using zero ‑ LLM design. Hybrid ChatGPT App: User → ChatGPT App → Backend → LLM APIs 6.2 Phase 2 Rules ✅ Hybrid intelligence MUST be: ❌ You may NOT: • Feature-scoped (limited to specific features) • User-initiated (user requests it) • Premium-gated (paid users only) • Isolated (separate API routes) • Cost-tracked (monitor per-user cost) • Convert entire app to hybrid • Auto-trigger hybrid features • Make hybrid required for core UX • Hide hybrid costs from analysis 6.3 Allowed Hybrid Features (Choose Up to 2) Feature What It Does Why It Needs LLM A. Adaptive Learning Path Analyzes patterns, generates personalized recommendations Requires reasoning over learning data B. LLM-Graded Assessments Evaluates free-form written answers with detailed feedback Rule-based can't evaluate reasoning C. Cross-Chapter Synthesis Connects concepts across chapters, generates "big picture" Requires multi-document reasoning D. AI Mentor Agent Long-running agent for complex tutoring workflows Multi-turn problem solving Panaversity Agent Factory Development | Page 8 of 24
