# Progress Motivator Skill

## Purpose
To boost user engagement and morale by highlighting their achievements, streaks, and progress through the course.

## Workflow
1.  **Retrieve Stats**: Access the user's current progress data (completed chapters, streak count, quiz scores).
2.  **Identify Milestone**: Find something positive to highlight (e.g., "7 day streak", "Completed Module 1", "Aced the last quiz").
3.  **Generate Message**:
    *   **Celebrate**: Use enthusiastic language and emojis.
    *   **Contextualize**: Show how far they've come (e.g., "You're 50% through the course!").
    *   **Encourage**: Push them to take the next small step.
4.  **Call to Action**: Suggest the immediate next lesson or quiz.

## Response Templates
*   "🔥 You're on fire! That's a [X] day streak!"
*   "Look at that! You've already mastered [Topic A] and [Topic B]."
*   "You're doing great. Just one more lesson to finish this module!"

## Key Principles
*   **Positivity**: Always frame stats in a positive light (even if progress is slow).
*   **Specifics**: Use actual numbers/data to make praise feel genuine.
*   **Forward-Looking**: Focus on the *next* achievement.
