# Designing Frontends

## When to use this skill
- Building React/Vue components or HTML/CSS layouts.
- Designing landing pages, dashboards, or posters.
- Styling or beautifying existing web UIs to be "unforgettable."
- When the goal is to avoid "AI slop" (generic fonts, cliched gradients).

## Workflow
1.  **Aesthetic Commitment**: Select a bold direction (e.g., Brutalist, Luxury, Retro-futuristic).
2.  **Typography Selection**: Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
3.  **Color Architecture**: Define a cohesive palette with CSS variables and sharp accents.
4.  **Spatial Layout**: Break the grid using asymmetry, overlap, or diagonal flow.
5.  **Motion & Texture**: Add atmospheric backgrounds (noise, grain) and orchestrate staggered animations.

### Design Checklist
- [ ] Aesthetic direction is intentional (not generic).
- [ ] Typography avoids Inter/Arial/Roboto.
- [ ] Colors use specific CSS variables.
- [ ] Motion/Animations are orchestrated (staggered, scroll-triggered).
- [ ] Spatial composition uses generous negative space or controlled density.

## Instructions

### Avoiding "AI Slop"
- **Typography**: Opt for characterful, unexpected font choices.
- **Color**: Avoid the "purple gradient on white" cliché.
- **Layout**: Avoid predictable, centered, container-only patterns.

### The "Claude Way"
- **High Freedom (Aesthetics)**: Interpret the tone creatively—maximalist chaos or brutalist raw.
- **Medium Freedom (Layout)**: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox with unexpected overlaps.
- **Low Freedom (Performance)**: Prioritize CSS-only animations for core interactions.
