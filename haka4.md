Before starting Hackathon IV, please complete the first three hackathons in order:

•⁠  ⁠Hackathon III: https://ggl.link/hackathon-3 
•⁠  ⁠Hackathon II: https://ggl.link/hackathon-2 
•⁠  ⁠Hackathon I: https://ggl.link/hackathon-1 







1. Executive Summary
1.1 The Challenge
Build a Course Companion FTE — a Digital Full-Time Equivalent that serves as a 24/7 educational tutor, working 168 hours per week at 85-90% cost savings compared to human tutors.
1.2 The Innovation
This hackathon applies the Agent Factory Architecture to education:
General Agents (Claude Code) manufacture the Custom Agent using Spec-Driven Development
Custom Agents (Digital FTE) deliver tutoring at scale with enterprise-grade reliability
Dual Frontends - ChatGPT App (Phase 1 and 2) + Web (Phase 3) provide maximum reach
Zero-Backend-LLM Default ensures cost efficiency and scalability (Phase 1)
1.3 The Outcome
A production-ready Digital FTE that can:
Tutor thousands of students simultaneously
Operate 24/7 without fatigue
Students can use the app from inside ChatGPT or a stand alone Web App
Maintain 99%+ consistency in educational delivery
Scale from 10 to 100,000 users without linear cost increase

The hackathon enforces a modern AI architecture principle: start with a Zero‑Backend‑LLM architecture (see Appendix I) by default (Phase 1), and introduce Hybrid intelligence (Phase 2) only where it is demonstrably valuable, cost‑justified, and premium. In Phase 3 a stand alone end-to-end Web App is required to be built with full features.

2. The Digital FTE Thesis
"In the AI era, the most valuable educational platforms won't sell courses — they'll hire Digital Tutors that work 168 hours per week, powered by agents, specs, skills, MCP, and cloud-native technologies."

Phase 2 Addition: L4 + L5 (Hybrid SDK) for premium features
4.3 Zero-Backend-LLM Architecture Principle
Key Insight: In Phase 1, ChatGPT does ALL the intelligent work. Your backend is purely deterministic — serving content, tracking progress, and enforcing rules. This means near-zero marginal cost per user.
Backend Responsibilities
ChatGPT Responsibilities
Serve content verbatim from R2
Track progress and streaks
Grade quizzes (rule-based)
Enforce access control
Search content (keyword/embedding)
Explain concepts at learner's level
Provide analogies and examples
Answer questions from content
Encourage and motivate
Adapt tone to student


5. Phase 1 ChatGPT App: Zero-Backend-LLM
5.1 Phase 1 Goal
Build a fully functional Course Companion where:
Backend performs ZERO LLM inference
ChatGPT handles ALL explanation, tutoring, and adaptation
System is production-viable and can scale to 100k+ users cheaply
5.2 Architecture Rules (STRICT)
Zero‑Backend‑LLM:
User → ChatGPT App → Deterministic Backend
✅ ALLOWED in Backend
Component
Purpose
Example

5.4 Disqualification Criteria
Teams are IMMEDIATELY DISQUALIFIED from Phase 1 if the backend contains ANY LLM API calls, summarization logic, or agent loops. Detection method: Code review + API audit.

6. Phase 2 ChatGPT App: Hybrid Intelligence (Paid Premium)
6.1 Phase 2 Goal
Add selective backend intelligence that:
Delivers clear additional educational value
Is cost-justified as a premium feature
Is cleanly isolated from Phase 1 logic
Teams must explain why each hybrid feature cannot be implemented using zero‑LLM design.
Hybrid ChatGPT App:
User → ChatGPT App → Backend → LLM APIs


6.2 Phase 2 Rules
✅ Hybrid intelligence MUST be:
❌ You may NOT:
Feature-scoped (limited to specific features)
User-initiated (user requests it)
Premium-gated (paid users only)
Isolated (separate API routes)
Cost-tracked (monitor per-user cost)
Convert entire app to hybrid
Auto-trigger hybrid features
Make hybrid required for core UX
Hide hybrid costs from analysis

6.3 Allowed Hybrid Features (Choose Up to 2)
Feature
What It Does
Why It Needs LLM
A. Adaptive Learning Path
Analyzes patterns, generates personalized recommendations
Requires reasoning over learning data
B. LLM-Graded Assessments
Evaluates free-form written answers with detailed feedback
Rule-based can't evaluate reasoning
C. Cross-Chapter Synthesis
Connects concepts across chapters, generates "big picture"
Requires multi-document reasoning
D. AI Mentor Agent
Long-running agent for complex tutoring workflows
Multi-turn problem solving





Phase 2 ChatGPT App Architecture Pattern
ChatGPT App
 ↓
Backend
 ├─ Deterministic APIs (Phase 1)
 └─ Hybrid Intelligence APIs (Phase 2, gated)
     └─ LLM calls
Teams must clearly show:
Which features are zero-LLM


Which features are hybrid


Why hybrid was necessary


Estimated cost per user


7. Phase 3 Web App
Full end-to-end Web App.
Phase 2 Web App Architecture Pattern
Web App (Next.js)
 ↓
Backend
 └─ APIs (All Features) (FastAPIs)
     └─ LLM calls
For Web App there will be a single set of APIs
8. Agent Skills Design
Agent Skills teach the Course Companion FTE how to perform educational tasks consistently. Each skill is a SKILL.md file containing procedural knowledge.
8.1 Required Runtime Skills
Skill Name

GOLDEN RULES
Zero-Backend-LLM is the default. Hybrid intelligence must always be selective, justified, and premium.Your Spec is your Source Code. If you can describe the excellence you want, AI can build the Digital FTE to deliver it.




Appendix I : Zero-Backend-LLM vs Hybrid Architecture
Below is a clear, side-by-side, decision-grade comparison of Zero-Backend-LLM vs Hybrid architecture, specifically in the context of ChatGPT Apps, AI-native books, and agentic education tools.
I will avoid theory and focus on engineering, cost, risk, and product impact.

1️⃣ Definitions (precise)
Zero-Backend-LLM Architecture
No LLM calls in your backend


ChatGPT does all reasoning, explanation, tutoring


Backend is deterministic


Content is served verbatim


Hybrid Architecture
ChatGPT does user interaction


Backend also calls LLMs


Backend performs:


RAG reasoning


Summarization


Evaluation


Agent workflows

4️⃣ Cost profile (real numbers)
Zero-Backend-LLM
LLM inference: $0


Storage + bandwidth: cents/user/month


Flat infra cost


Hybrid
LLM inference: scales with usage


Embeddings + re-ranking


Agent loops


Cost spikes under load


Hybrid requires pricing discipline. Zero-LLM does not.

5️⃣ Engineering complexity
Zero-Backend-LLM
You build:
Content APIs


Search


Entitlement checks


Progress tracking


You do NOT build:
Prompt orchestration


Agent memory


Token optimization


Cost controls



Hybrid
You must manage:
Prompt versions


Token limits


Model selection


Latency budgets


Cost ceilings


Agent failures


This is real operational burden.

6️⃣ Quality & correctness
Zero-Backend-LLM
ChatGPT answers only from provided text


Easy to enforce:


 “If not in content, say ‘not covered’”



Excellent for education & documentation


Hybrid
More flexible


More creative


More hallucination vectors


Requires guardrails



7️⃣ Personalization & intelligence
Zero-Backend-LLM
Can do:
Explain differently


Simplify


Give analogies


Adjust tone


Cannot do:
Deep learner modeling


Long-term adaptive planning


Cross-content synthesis beyond provided text



Hybrid
Can do:
Personalized learning paths


Skill graphs


Adaptive curricula


Automated assessment


Spec-driven feedback



8️⃣ Where each architecture wins
Zero-Backend-LLM is best for:
✅ Books
 ✅ Courses
 ✅ Reference manuals
 ✅ LMS companions
 ✅ Corporate training
 ✅ Compliance content
Hybrid is best for:
✅ Coding agents
 ✅ Research agents
 ✅ Analytics platforms
 ✅ Personalized tutors
 ✅ Autonomous workflows

9️⃣ Risk & business impact
Zero-Backend-LLM
Predictable costs


Easy pricing


Fewer outages


Faster iteration


Lower team size


Hybrid
Cost overruns risk


Model regressions


Vendor dependency


Requires MLOps discipline



🔟 A common mistake to avoid
❌ Starting with Hybrid too early
Most teams:
Overestimate need for backend intelligence


Underestimate ops complexity


Struggle with margins


Best practice:
Start zero-LLM → add hybrid only where value is proven.

11️⃣ Recommended evolution path (important)
Phase 1: Zero-Backend-LLM
  ↓
Phase 2: Hybrid for premium users
  ↓
Phase 3: Agentic workflows (optional)

Example:
Free users: zero-LLM


Pro users: hybrid (adaptive tutoring, exams)



12️⃣ Decision checklist (use this)
Choose Zero-Backend-LLM if:
You sell content


You want low cost


You want predictable scaling


You care about correctness


Choose Hybrid if:
Intelligence is the product


You need autonomy


You can charge accordingly


You have ops maturity



Bottom line
Zero-Backend-LLM
Cheap


Simple


Scalable


Ideal for education & books


Hybrid
Powerful


Expensive


Complex


Needed for advanced agents


Given your AI-native book + LMS direction,
 👉 Zero-Backend-LLM should be your default architecture
 👉 Hybrid should be selective and premium
