# PHR: Implemented Phase 3 Full-Stack Web LMS

The Course Companion has been transformed into a production-ready standalone web application.

## Key Implementation Details
- **Frontend**: Modular React architecture with Tailwind CSS styling.
- **Backend**: Consolidated FastAPI routes with JWT security and RBAC middleware.
- **Database**: SQLModel schemas updated for SaaS roles and Neon Postgres stability.
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Gated AI grading and adaptive paths integrated into the new web UI.
- **Operational Readiness**: Admin console for cost and usage tracking, plus Docker orchestration.
