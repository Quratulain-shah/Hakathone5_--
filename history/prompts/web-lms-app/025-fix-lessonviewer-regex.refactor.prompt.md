# PHR: Fixed unterminated regex in LessonViewer

The syntax error in `src/components/LessonViewer.tsx` where a literal newline was used inside a regex literal has been corrected.

## Details
- **Issue**: `String(children).replace(/ 
 $/ , '')` had a raw newline.
- **Fix**: Changed to `String(children).replace(/
$/, '')`.
