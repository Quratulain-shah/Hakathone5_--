# PHR: Generated Phase 3 Web LMS Tasks

The tasks are structured to support incremental delivery, starting with the core LMS functionality (US1) and layering on premium and admin features.

## Key Highlights
- **Atomic Tasks**: Each task includes a specific file path and measurable goal.
- **Story Mapping**: Tasks are explicitly linked to [US1], [US2], or [US3].
- **Parallelization**: Identified multiple opportunities for concurrent frontend and backend work.
- **MVP Focus**: Phase 3 is highlighted as the primary goal for initial functional delivery.
