# PHR: Created Phase 3 Web LMS Specification

The specification defines the behavioral requirements for the standalone Web LMS, focusing on user journeys and measurable outcomes.

## Key Decisions
- **Role-Based Access**: Defined specific capabilities for Free, Premium, and Admin users.
- **Hybrid Integration**: Retained Phase 2 AI features as premium-only enhancements.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Set 100k concurrent users as a primary success metric.
