# PHR: Completed Phase 3 Web LMS Engineering Plan

The plan establishes the technical foundation for the standalone LMS, transitioning the project from a backend-only prototype to a production-grade web application.

## Key Decisions
- **Full-Stack Separation**: Decoupled React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- **Persistent Progress**: Transitioned from transient state to Neon Postgres.
- **SaaS Readiness**: Implemented JWT auth and admin analytics architecture.
- **Hybrid Isolation**: Confined LLM logic to the `/premium/` namespace.
