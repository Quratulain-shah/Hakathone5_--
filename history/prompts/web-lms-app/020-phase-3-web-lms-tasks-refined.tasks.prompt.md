# PHR: Refined Phase 3 Web LMS Tasks

The updated task list provides a direct engineering roadmap for building the standalone LMS, ensuring that Phase 1 and 2 capabilities are preserved while adding SaaS-grade features.

## Key Highlights
- **Phased Delivery**: Clearly separated Setup, Foundational, and User Story phases.
- **Regression Focus**: Specific tasks added to verify Phase 1 (content) and Phase 2 (hybrid) features.
- **Scalability**: Included database pooling and performance optimization tasks to support 100k concurrent users.
- **Clear Mapping**: All implementation tasks are tagged with [US1], [US2], or [US3] for traceability.
