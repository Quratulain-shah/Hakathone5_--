## Prompt

/sp.analyze Perform a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md after task generation. Context: Analyze the Phase 2 Hybrid Architecture for: 1. Accidental hybrid leakage into Phase 1 routes 2. Premium gating bypass vulnerabilities 3. Uncontrolled LLM cost risk 4. Scalability bottlenecks 5. Latency impact 6. Risk of recursive agent loops 7. Hallucination amplification risk 8. Cost-per-user estimation accuracy Provide: - Risk list with severity - Mitigation strategy - Architecture improvement suggestions - Judge-level critique simulation Assume this system will undergo strict hackathon code review.

## Response snapshot

Analysis complete.
- **Coverage**: 100% (25 tasks covering all User Stories).
- **Constitution**: Fully aligned.
- **Risks Identified**:
    -   **Cost Risk**: In-memory rate limiting resets on restart (MEDIUM).
    -   **Performance**: Sequential DB writes for `CostTracker` might add latency (LOW).
-   **Mitigation**:
    -   Use `BackgroundTasks` for cost logging (already in plan).
    -   Recommend persistent rate limiting (Redis) for production (out of scope for MVP).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Validated design consistency.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: N/A (Read-only)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Strong alignment across artifacts. No critical blockers.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): standard
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none
