## Prompt

/sp.plan Create a detailed Engineering Plan for implementing Phase 2 Hybrid Intelligence.

Context:
Phase 1 deterministic backend already exists.

Plan must include:

1. Folder separation strategy:
   - Core deterministic services
   - Premium hybrid services

2. API structure:
   - /premium/assessment
   - /premium/adaptive-path

3. Premium user verification workflow
4. LLM service abstraction layer
5. Cost tracking mechanism:
   - Token estimation
   - Per-request logging
   - Monthly aggregation

6. Failure handling strategy:
   - LLM timeout
   - Rate limits
   - Unexpected responses

7. Isolation enforcement:
   - No imports of hybrid services in deterministic modules
   - Clear boundary documentation

8. Performance considerations
9. Deployment impact analysis
10. Testing strategy:
    - Premium gating tests
    - Hybrid-only route tests
    - Regression tests for Phase 1

Emphasize architectural separation and cost discipline.

## Response snapshot

Generated Implementation Plan for Phase 2 Hybrid Features. Includes strict isolation strategy (new `/premium` API namespace), Cost Tracking via `TokenUsage` table, and Gemini 1.5 Flash integration.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete technical plan and design artifacts generated.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: specs/002-phase-2-hybrid/plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml, quickstart.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan strictly adheres to the new Constitution v2.0.0.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): standard
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none
