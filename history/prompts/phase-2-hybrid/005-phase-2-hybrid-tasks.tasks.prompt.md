## Prompt

/sp.tasks Break Phase 2 Hybrid Intelligence implementation into atomic tasks grouped by: 1. Premium Tier Infrastructure 2. Hybrid API Routing 3. LLM Service Layer 4. LLM-Graded Assessment Feature 5. Adaptive Learning Path Feature 6. Cost Tracking System 7. Error Handling & Resilience 8. Security & Abuse Prevention 9. Logging & Monitoring 10. Testing & Validation Each task must: - Be small and actionable - Include clear completion criteria - Include architectural compliance verification - Mention separation validation (no hybrid leakage into Phase 1)

## Response snapshot

Generated actionable `tasks.md` with 25 tasks across 6 phases. Organized by User Stories (Assessments, Adaptive Path, Cost Control) with clear dependencies and parallel execution paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Detailed task list generated and ready for implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: specs/002-phase-2-hybrid/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks enforced the separation of concerns mandated by Constitution v2.0.0.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
