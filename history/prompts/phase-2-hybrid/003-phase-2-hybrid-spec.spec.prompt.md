## Prompt

/sp.specify Write a Phase 2 Specification Document for the Course Companion FTE teaching AI Agent Development. Scope: Add Hybrid Intelligence Premium Features while preserving Phase 1 architecture. Hybrid features selected: 1. LLM-Graded Assessment 2. Adaptive Learning Path Specification must include: 1. Overview of Phase 2 objective 2. Clear distinction between: - Phase 1 deterministic features - Phase 2 hybrid features 3. Premium tier definition 4. Functional Requirements for: FR-H1: LLM-Graded Assessment - User submits free-form written answer - System evaluates reasoning depth - System returns structured feedback - System assigns rubric-based score - Justification for why rule-based grading is insufficient FR-H2: Adaptive Learning Path - System analyzes quiz performance patterns - System identifies weak topics - System generates personalized study recommendations - Justification for why deterministic logic is insufficient 5. Acceptance Criteria (measurable and technology-agnostic) 6. Cost Awareness Requirement 7. Edge Cases: - Non-premium access attempt - Excessive hybrid usage - Invalid submission - Empty answer 8. Assumptions and Boundaries 9. Success Criteria: - Hybrid calls only occur for premium users - Phase 1 performance unaffected - Hybrid features deliver measurable personalization benefit Do NOT include implementation details. Do NOT describe SDKs or libraries. Focus on behavior and business value.

## Response snapshot

Created Feature Branch `002-phase-2-hybrid` and drafted `spec.md` including LLM-Graded Assessment and Adaptive Learning Path requirements. Validated against quality checklist.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase 2 Spec created and validated.
- 🧪 Tests: Checklist passed.
- 📁 Files: specs/002-phase-2-hybrid/spec.md, specs/002-phase-2-hybrid/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec strictly follows the new Constitution's separation of concerns.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PowerShell argument parsing issue with `create-new-feature.ps1`.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): standard
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Fix PowerShell script argument handling.
